# Pick Up App

The Pick-up app is a tool for riders to schedule a car pick-up to their local destination. The app’s automated dispatch checks a drivers' availability and pairs with a compatible pick-up request. The app shows riders that the pick-up has been booked.

## Our Approach

### User Stories

* I can create an Order
* I can view my Order once created, and see:
⋅⋅1. My Confirmation Number
⋅⋅2. My Pick Up Location
⋅⋅3. My Drop Off Location
⋅⋅4. My Pick Up Time
* I can view an existing Order by entering my Order Id on the home page in the text field beneath the words Order Number 
* I can delete/cancel an Order by clicking "Cancel Order" on the Order confirmation page

### Acheiving CRUD

* C - Creating new Orders
* R - Showing a New Order once it is created OR showing an existing order once a user inputs the Order Id
* U - Updating/Modifying a Driver's availability when assigning them to an Order (when the Order is created) OR Updating/Modifying a Driver's availability when an Order is canceled
* D - Canceling an order
